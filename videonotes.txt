This is the completed task for a submission form with 
employee information, that includes file uploads, stores it into a 
database, and has a lookup page with filters 


first im going to run through the front end stuff, then ill get into the code

-----

first thing i did when coding is create the database and dbconnection file
dbconnection is used in submission and lookup 




submission 
	submission form that gets the users data to put in the database
	when submit button is pressed, is gets the data from those fields and puts them in a php variable
	file handing to put the files in a directory called file_uploads
	and the query to put the user data into the database table
	and then just error handing at the bottom


lookup
	similar form to the submission, except its a get method instead of post
	it allows the user to search and filter employees based on their information
	it checks to see if its set with any filters, if not then it leaves it blank
	the query to search the database based on the filter
	the results are put in a table, which has all the fields in the headers
	the table data is filled based on the filters and the query
	
conclusion
	i also have css in this page... and a navbar for easier navigation


and thats it!
